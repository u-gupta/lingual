As has been noted and is clarified in the later review of literature of review section. One problem area is that since the processes in ETL (Extraction-Transformation-Loading) is complex, the implementation takes more time (Shaker H.Ali El-Sappagh, 2011). The second problem area involves while data is extracted from different data sources, many incorporate information are also extracted which cause data warehouse becomes heavy and requires processing power.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this research with focus on two primary objective.

Ali El-Sappagh, 2011), therefore the ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) processes becomes more complexity. Data Stage tool is the one that make data transform effectively. Precisely, Data Stage tool make user easier to directly access file system in distributed data warehouse. Data Stage tool provides trustable, powerful and scalable platform to ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) tool which it can collect, integrate and transform data even it is complex. ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) tool itself couldn’t transform data effectively. The question that awake me in this research whether is it secure and reliable. It was secure since security controls allow user to have their “private” area which can only access by themselves and also have area that user can shared with others in a group.\r\n\r\nResearch Objectives\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this research with focus on two primary objective. The first objective is to improve performance of data abstraction by integrating Data Stage to ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) tool . The second objective are to propose a novel approach of Data Stage tool as ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) tool.\r\n\r\nLiterature Review\r\n\r\nIn this part, we will see some research that deals with ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) tool. SIRIUS (Supporting the Incremental Refreshment of Information Warehouses) is a project developed at information technology department in Zurich University (A.VAVOURAS,\"A Metadata-Driven Approach for DataWarehouse Refreshment\", Phd Thesis, DER UNIVERSITÄT ZÜRICH,ZÜRICH, 2002. ). This researcher represent modelling and execution of ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) by approaching metadata whereby it describe the features to implement ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading). Researcher use JAVA code to implement. Finally it was a successful implementation but requires sufficient amount of time. SIRIUS are also succeed in detecting changes in the database.\r\n\r\nARKTOS is a framework that are create to model and execute ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading). Indeed, ARKTOS provides primitives to capture ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) tasks frequently used (P. Vassiliadis, Z.Vagena, S. Skiadopoulos, and N.Karayannidis, \"ARKTOS: A Tool For Data Cleaning and Transformation in DataWarehouse Environments\", Bulletin of the Technical Committee on Data Engineering, 23(4), 2000). Precisely, ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) process consist of GUI( Graphical User Interface) and two language which is XADL( XML) and SADL(SQL). During execution, ARKTOS able to take action when error occur during implementation. There are few errors that can be solve by ARKTOS which is first violation of the primary key, violation of the uniqueness , violation of references , null existence for the elimination of missing values field mismatch and format mismatch related to domain errors and data format errors.\r\n\r\nThe next approaches deals with ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) management. Authors represent ETL as K matrices which apply multiplication operation that explain the connection between input and output fields and how it produce in the attribute dependency. Moreover author creates an algorithm to detect if error occur in ETL (Extraction-Transformation-Loading) process when delete event occur in source or inside ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading). Unfortunately, the changes that occur during deletion detection are not addresses to user.\r\n\r\nResearch Methodology\r\n\r\nThe study intends to investigate of using Data Stage tool as ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) tool in data warehouse. For this study, secondary research based on recent literature related to ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) tool and data warehouse will used. I used secondary research because within the recent journal I analyse the limitation of ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) tool. Data Stage tool have the ability to increase the performance when it corporates with ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) tools because Data Stage consist of parallel framework that supports integration of data.\r\n\r\nMove over, the descriptive research will utilised. Thus this study will use the descriptive approach. The descriptive type of research utilises observation in the study. To illustrate the descriptive type of research, (Cress Well, 1994) guided the researcher when he stated descriptive method of research is to gather information about the present existing condition. I gather the information related to the studies of ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) tool and data warehouse to makes use of Data Stage tool as an ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) tool in data warehouse that brings some beneficial to user. ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) tool consumes more time and resources during data integration. Data Stage tool have flexible platform that can integrates all type of data which reduce the time taken.\r\n\r\nThis studies also will employ qualitative research method because it will try to find and build theories that will explain the relationship of one variable with another variable through qualitative elements in research. I have choose qualitative research method for my research because to explain as an ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) tool and the relationship of Data Stage tool as an ETL(Extraction-Transformation-Loading) tool in data warehouse.
